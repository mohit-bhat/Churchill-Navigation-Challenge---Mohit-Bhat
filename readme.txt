Welcome to the Churchill Navigation Programming Exercise

We appreciate your interest in working on our team!  We want you to know that your Programming Exercise submission will never be used for any purpose other than as a way for us to have some idea of your coding skills.

Here are the files to get you started:
point_search.h   : Header file containing the precise problem definition and describing the DLL's interface.
point_search.exe : The testing framework that can load one or more DLLs, evaluate their performance and compare their results.
reference.dll    : Reference solution that is used to test other solutions for correctness.
