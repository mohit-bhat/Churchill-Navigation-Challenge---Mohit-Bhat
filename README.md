#  Churchill Navigation Challenge

This is my work done on the churchill navigation challenge.
The "Rhino" folder contains my best working approach. access the dll through rhino/x64/release/


Dll1:
Initial attempt to get a DLL file to work in c++, DLL not valid

Abandoned to try different configuration.

Dll2:
Second attempt with different configuration, DLL not valid

Abandoned to try different configuration.

Dll3:
attempt to get DLL file to work in visual basic, DLL not valid

Abandoned to try different configuration.

Dll4:
attempt to get DLL file to work in c#, DLL not valid

Abandoned to try different configuration.

Dll5:
Third attempt to get DLL file to work in c++, DLL not valid

Abandoned to try different configuration.

Dll6:
Fourth attempt to get DLL file to work in c++ using binary search tree for data, DLL valid, solution invalid

Abandoned due to structure taking too much time

Dll7:
Attempt using c++ standard libray map structure, DLL valid, solution invalid

Abandoned due to structure taking too much time

Dll8:
attempt using array of points unsorted, DLL valid, solution invalid
Abandoned to try different configuration.

Dll9:
attempt using binary search tree again, except using multiple trees each for a "box" of points in a specific x range, DLL valid, solution invalid

Abandoned due to structure taking too much time

Dll10:
attempt searching through an unsorted set and inserting into output array, DLL valid, solution valid

Abandoned due to structure taking too much time

Dll11:
attempt using k-d tree to store data, DLL valid, solution invalid

Abandoned in favor of simpler approach to get working solution

Dll12:
attempt using array sorted by rank and searching until "count" points are found, DLL valid, solution valid

Abandoned for cleaner version Rhino.

Dll13:
atempt using k-d tree with buckets of points sorted by rank, DLL valid, solution invalid

Currently working on this solution.

Rhino:
solution attempt, trimmed down and commented version of Dll12, Dll valid, solution valid

Submission.
